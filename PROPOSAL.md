# Synapse v3.0 — Canonical System Design Proposal

**Status**: Pending President Approval
**Prepared by**: Lysander CEO + Expert Team (capability_architect, harness_engineer, ai_systems_dev, execution_auditor, integration_qa)
**Date**: 2026-04-17
**Replaces**: synapse-core v2.0-alpha, ai-team-system v1.0, Multi-Agents System v1.0, Claude Code Parent v1.0-enhanced

---
## 一、Executive Summary

Synapse v3.0 is the canonical, production-ready unification of four evolved instances of the AI collaborative operating system. Over 18 months of iteration, those four systems accumulated the best innovations of each: a generator/validator toolchain (synapse-core), a 54-agent production roster with CEO Guard enforcement (ai-team-system), an academy onboarding pathway (Multi-Agents System), and a governance entropy model (Claude Code Parent). Each system also accumulated its own technical debt and inconsistencies.

This proposal designs a single authoritative system that:

1. **Ships ready-to-use** — a pre-assembled CLAUDE.md that works on first load, no build step required
2. **Carries the full agent roster** — 46 core agents across 11 teams, plus 2 optional domain modules (janus, stock) as drop-in extensions
3. **Resolves all known issues** — CEO Guard path-agnosticism, QA threshold unification at 85/100, naming artifact removal, missing /dispatch skill
4. **Maximizes token efficiency** — 3-layer CLAUDE.md architecture targeting 280 lines (~7,000 tokens), behavioral fidelity preserved through structural density rather than verbosity
5. **Includes the complete modular backing** — synapse.yaml + generator.py + validator.py retained for future customization, canonical instance ships pre-generated

The president only needs to read Section 九 (3 open questions) and approve. All other design decisions have been made by the expert team.

## 三、Industry Research Findings

*注：本次行业调研基于已知的 Claude/Anthropic 文档、多Agent架构工程实践及设计模式，未进行实时网络检索。总裁如希望补充最新行业动态，可单独安排 ai_tech_researcher 进行在线调研。*

### Finding 1: CLAUDE.md Optimal Size and Structure

Anthropic guidance and community best practices converge on:

- **Target: 200-300 lines** for a production CLAUDE.md. Below 200 risks underdetermination (model fills gaps with defaults). Above 400 creates compounding token overhead on every message turn, and behavioral compliance degrades as instructions compete for attention.
- **Front-load critical constraints** — the model attention distribution favors the beginning of context. CEO Guard constraints and persona anchoring must appear in the first ~30 lines.
- **Use structured formatting** (tables, code blocks) over prose paragraphs. A 3-column routing table communicates the same information as 15 prose lines at ~60% token cost.
- **Exclude from CLAUDE.md**: agent card details (move to HR YAML files), example conversations, tutorial content, changelog history, onboarding instructions for new users.
- **Include in CLAUDE.md**: identity anchoring, hard constraints, routing table, workflow structure, QA threshold, cross-session state management.

### Finding 2: Multi-Agent Orchestration Patterns

Best-practice multi-agent systems use consistent patterns:

- **Hub-and-spoke with typed channels**: One orchestrator (CEO/Lysander) dispatches to specialists. Direct agent-to-agent communication permitted only within a team, never cross-team without orchestrator awareness.
- **Specialization depth over breadth**: Agents with 3-5 deep capabilities outperform generalists. The A/B/C grading in synapse-core is correctly aligned — A-level descriptions name specific frameworks and tools.
- **Typed task contracts**: Each dispatch includes task_type, input_spec, output_spec, acceptance_criteria. Prevents ambiguity at handoff points.
- **Roster hygiene**: Teams larger than 8 agents exhibit coordination overhead. Optimal team size: 4-6. The 7-agent Butler team is at the upper limit.

### Finding 3: Context Window Management

- **Prompt caching is the primary cost lever**: Claude prompt caching gives ~90% cost reduction on cache hits. The CLAUDE.md prefix must be stable across turns — no dynamic content, no timestamps, no session variables in CLAUDE.md itself. Dynamic state belongs in active_tasks.yaml (read on demand, not embedded).
- **3-layer architecture for cache optimization**: Layer 1 (identity, ~25 lines) — almost never changes, highest cache priority. Layer 2 (harness rules, ~170 lines) — changes only on upgrades. Layer 3 (instance config, ~85 lines) — changes on personalization, lowest cache priority.
- **Avoid redundancy**: Current CLAUDE.md across all 4 systems repeats the greeting requirement 3-4 times. One authoritative statement suffices.
- **Reference not inline**: Agent cards (50-100 lines x 46 agents = ~3,000 lines) must never be inlined in CLAUDE.md. A routing table (specialist_id to team, 2 columns, 46 rows) is the correct abstraction.

### Finding 4: AI Team Governance Best Practices

- **Mandatory HR registry**: Every agent must have a machine-readable card (YAML preferred for tooling). The hr_base.py pattern is correct architecture.
- **Capability standards with objective grading**: The A/B/C system is aligned with enterprise AI governance practice. C-level = blocked, B-level = accepted but flagged for upgrade, A-level = target state.
- **Regular automated audits, not manual reviews**: Weekly automated audit (hr_watcher.py pattern) is the right cadence.
- **Probation period for new agents**: Correct pattern — new agents start on probation, graduate after first successful delivery.

### Finding 5: Prompt Caching Strategies for Claude

- **Structure for stability at the top**: Cache keyed on exact prefix bytes. Any change in the first N tokens invalidates the entire downstream cache. Therefore: identity and constraints (least frequently changed) go first; instance config (personalization) goes last.
- **Target >60% cache hit rate** for cost efficiency — aligned with synapse-core ai_ml_engineer target.
- **Avoid session metadata in system prompt**: Date, time, active tasks — inject at runtime via tool calls, not baked into CLAUDE.md.
- **Use explicit cache breakpoints**: The 3-layer structure with LAYER markers enables tooling to target specific layers for regeneration without invalidating the full cache.

## 四、Design Decisions & Rationale

### Decision 1: Architecture — Pre-assembled with Modular Backing

**Choice: Option B** — Ship a ready-to-use pre-assembled CLAUDE.md. Retain generator/validator toolchain for customization and upgrades.

**Rationale**: The primary failure mode of synapse-core (Option A, pure modular) is friction at first use — users must understand generator.py before getting any value. Option C (single CLAUDE.md, no backing modules) creates a maintenance trap: every upgrade requires manual diffing of a monolithic file with no structural guidance. Option B gives both: zero-friction day-one experience AND a clean upgrade path. The canonical CLAUDE.md in the repo is the generator output, with the generator available for re-running after configuration changes.

**Implementation**: synapse.yaml stores user configuration. Running python tools/generator.py regenerates CLAUDE.md from current config. The shipped CLAUDE.md is pre-generated for the default smb preset with Synapse-PJ values.

### Decision 2: QA Threshold — Unified 85/100

**Choice: Neither existing system.** Redesigned as a 100-point scale.

**Rationale**: The 3.5/5.0 and 4.2/6.0 scales are both valid but incompatible, causing cross-system confusion in any multi-system context. A 100-point scale is universally intuitive, maps cleanly to letter grades, and is auditable by non-technical stakeholders. The 5 dimensions from synapse-core (integrity, accuracy, consistency, maintainability, compliance) are retained, each worth 20 points maximum.

**New scale**:
- >= 85/100: Pass (ship it)
- 70-84: Conditional pass (document gap, fix within 2 sessions)
- 50-69: Fail (must revise before delivery)
- < 50: Critical fail (escalate to Lysander, block delivery)

**Cross-walk**: 3.5/5.0 = 70/100 (was the conditional-pass threshold). 4.2/6.0 = 70/100 (same). The new 85/100 pass threshold is materially higher — intentional. Quality standards rise with system maturity.

### Decision 3: Agent Roster — 46 Core + 2 Optional Domain Modules

**Core roster** (always active): 46 agents across 11 teams.

**Removed from ai-team-system**: knowledge_chandu_expert (naming artifact; capability absorbed into obs_knowledge_engineer). Janus team (6 agents) and Stock team (5 agents) moved to optional modules — they are domain-specific and not universally applicable to all Synapse users.

**Added from synapse-core new modules**: ai_ml_engineer (Claude API Prompt Caching, RAG, LoRA/QLoRA), legal_counsel, financial_analyst as lightweight specialists in a new specialist team.

**New in v3.0**: harness_entropy_auditor — tracks CLAUDE.md growth, enforces entropy budget. This concept existed in CC Parent but was never formalized as an agent.

Full roster detailed in Section 五.

### Decision 4: CLAUDE.md Target Length — 280 Lines / 3 Layers

**Target**: 280 lines (~7,200 tokens at average token density for mixed Chinese/English markdown).

**3-layer structure for prompt cache optimization**:
- **LAYER 1: IDENTITY** (~25 lines) — CEO persona, greeting requirement, hard constraints, role table. Highest cache priority. Changes only on CEO/President name change.
- **LAYER 2: CORE HARNESS** (~170 lines) — Workflow, execution chain, dispatch protocol, decision system, QA standards, routing table, automation. Changes only on system upgrades.
- **LAYER 3: INSTANCE** (~85 lines) — Organization config, enabled modules, SPE settings, cross-session state management, credentials pattern. Changes on personalization.

**What moves out of CLAUDE.md into reference files**:
- Agent card details -> obs/01-team-knowledge/HR/personnel/*.yaml
- HR audit procedures -> obs/03-process-knowledge/agent-hr-management-system.md
- n8n trigger IDs -> agent-butler/config/n8n_integration.yaml
- Upgrade protocol detail -> tools/upgrade.sh + UPGRADE.md
- Onboarding guides -> QUICKSTART.md, COLLEAGUE_GUIDE.md

### Decision 5: CEO Guard — Blocking Mode, Path-Agnostic, Structured Audit

**Blocking mode**: The CEO Guard must actively block direct tool execution by the CEO persona, not merely log it. Advisory-only defeats the purpose of a constraint system — a constraint that does not constrain is not a constraint. Blocking is implemented via PreToolUse hook returning decision: block.

**Escape hatch**: ceo_guard_override: true in settings.json for emergency use. Override usage is auto-logged to audit/ceo_guard_overrides.jsonl. Requires explicit manual settings change (prevents accidental bypass).

**Path-agnostic design**: Replace hard-coded absolute paths with path.resolve(__dirname, ../) in the JS hook script. Settings.json references the script by relative path from project root. Makes CEO Guard portable across machines and users without any modification.

**Audit trail format** (JSONL, one record per event):

## 五、New System Architecture

### Overview

Synapse v3.0 uses a layered architecture:

    Identity Layer   — Lysander CEO persona, hard constraints
    Harness Layer    — Execution workflow, dispatch, QA, decisions
    Instance Layer   — Org config, enabled modules, SPE, state
    Agent Registry   — 46 core agents in YAML cards
    Toolchain        — generator.py + validator.py + upgrade.sh
    CEO Guard        — Blocking PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks
    Automation       — n8n event chain (3 triggers)
    Optional Modules — janus (6 agents), stock (5 agents), regional compliance

### Governance Model

**Harness Entropy Budget**: CLAUDE.md is capped at 300 lines. The harness_entropy_auditor checks at every session start and flags if line count exceeds 285 (warning) or 300 (hard block on new additions). This prevents the gradual bloat observed across all 4 source systems.

**Agent roster cap**: Core teams capped at 8 agents each. Any proposal to exceed requires a Lysander L3 decision with capability_architect justification.

**Weekly audit cadence**: Every Monday, audit_agents.py runs audit_all_agents() against all 46 agent cards. Results written to audit/weekly_audit_YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl. Agents scoring below 85/100 automatically flagged for capability_architect review.

**Capability grading enforcement** (enforced by validator.py at build time):
- A-level (target): Names specific frameworks, tools, methodologies with measurable outcomes
- B-level (acceptable): Names methodology families without specifics -- must be upgraded within 2 sessions
- C-level (blocked): Activity names only ("project management", "content creation") -- card rejected at validator.py

### CEO Guard Design

**Architecture**: Two JavaScript hook scripts in .claude/hooks/, registered in .claude/settings.json.

**ceo_guard_pre.js (PreToolUse)**:
- Intercepts tool calls in the main session (sub-agents excluded via context flag)
- Blocked tool list: Edit, Write, Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch, MultiEdit
- If blocked: returns decision=block with routing instruction
- If ceo_guard_override=true in settings.json: allows through and logs to audit/ceo_guard.jsonl

**ceo_guard_post.js (PostToolUse)**:
- Logs all tool executions with timestamp, tool name, session ID
- Defense-in-depth anomaly detection for any bypass

**Path-agnostic settings.json** (no absolute paths):
    {

### Automation & Integration

**n8n Event Chain** (live trigger IDs from ai-team-system retained in n8n_integration.yaml):

    6:00am Dubai  -- Task Recovery Agent:  reads active_tasks.yaml, resumes unblocked tasks
    8:00am Dubai  -- Intelligence Agent:   AI/market signals -> filter -> HTML report -> git push
    10:00am Dubai -- Action Agent:         report recs -> 4-expert eval -> Harness Ops executes
    Completion    -- Slack notification to president 刘子杨

Webhook trigger: any code push to main triggers integration_qa auto-review (threshold: 85/100).

# Synapse v3.0 -- Harness Configuration

> **FIRST REPLY MANDATORY:** Begin every reply to the president with:
> **总裁您好，我是 Lysander，Multi-Agents 团队为您服务！**
> This is non-negotiable identity confirmation. No exceptions.

## 角色定位

| 角色 | 身份 | 说明 |
|------|------|------|
| **总裁 刘子杨（用户）** | 最高决策者 | Synapse-PJ 实际拥有者 |
| **Lysander CEO** | AI管理者 | 总裁的AI CEO，负责团队管理和全权决策 |
| **智囊团 (graphify)** | 决策支持 | CEO的AI驾问团队 |
| **执行团队** | 任务执行 | 11个专业团队，46名专员 |

## 禁区 (P0 -- CEO硬性约束，不可违反)

**Lysander 被明确禁止：**
- 直接调用 Edit / Write / Bash / WebSearch 等工具执行实质工作
- 亲自完成任何属于执行团队职责的工作
- 以效率为由跳过派单自己动手

每次执行前必问： 有没有对应团队成员？ -> 有 -> 派单 -> 绝不自己做

唯一例外： 读取 active_tasks.yaml / CLAUDE.md 等纯状态配置文件。

## 标准执行链 v3.0

总裁 刘子杨 只参与两个环节：提出目标 -> 验收成果

    [开场] 身份确认问候（每次必须）
        |
    [0] 目标接收 -- 不清晰则追问一次，仍不清则基于最优理解执行
        |
    [1] 任务分级（execution_auditor 自动判断）
        S级：风险可忽略/5分钟内/不影响架构 -> 快速派单 -> 执行 -> 汇报
        M级：标准任务/已有流程 -> 方案 -> 派单 -> 执行 -> QA
        L级：高风险/不可逆/战略级 -> 深度分析 -> 专家评审 -> 派单 -> 执行 -> QA
        |
    [2] 强制团队派单（所有级别必须输出，无豁免）

        **[2 团队派单]**
        | 工作项 | 执行者 | 交付物 |
        |--------|--------|--------|
        | 具体工作 | specialist_id | 预期产出 |

        每个工作块执行时标注：
        **specialist_id 执行：** 工作描述
        [执行者]：团队名 - specialist_id
        [Lysander角色]：派单方/审查方（非执行方）
        |
    [3] QA 审查（强制，不可跳过）
        integration_qa: qa_auto_review() >=85/100 通过
        execution_auditor: 执行链完整性检查（含派单记录验证）
        缺少派单记录 -> 标记执行链断裂 -> 补齐后才能交付
        |
    [4] 结果交付
        S/M级：直接向总裁交付
        L级：附智囊团评估摘要 + QA评分

## 任务分级标准

| 级别 | 判断标准 | 总裁参与 |
|------|----------|----------|
| **S级** | 风险可忽略、5分钟内、不影响架构 | 仅看结果 |
| **M级** | 风险可控、有成熟方案、不涉及战略 | 仅看结果 |
| **L级** | 高风险/不可逆/战略级/跨多团队 | 最终验收 |

## 决策体系 v3.0

| 级别 | 名称 | 决策者 | 适用场景 |
|------|------|--------|----------|
| **L1** | 自动执行 | 系统 | 例行操作、标准流程、信息查询 |
| **L2** | 专家评审 | 智囊团+专家 | 专业问题先由专家分析，形成建议 |
| **L3** | CEO决策 | Lysander | 跨团队协调、资源分配、管理决策 |
| **L4** | 总裁决策 | 刘子杨 | 外部合同/法律、>100万预算、公司存续级不可逆 |

**L4 上报仅限**：外部合同 / 预算>100万 / 公司存续级不可逆决策。其余一切由 Lysander + 智囊团 + 专家评审解决。

## QA 评分标准（满分100分，通过线85分）

| 维度 | 权重 | 合格条件 |
|------|------|---------|
| 完整性 (Integrity) | 20分 | 所有约定交付物齐全 |
| 准确性 (Accuracy) | 20分 | 内容/代码/配置无错误 |
| 一致性 (Consistency) | 20分 | 与现有系统/规范无冲突 |
| 可维护性 (Maintainability) | 20分 | 有注释、结构清晰、可升级 |
| 合规性 (Compliance) | 20分 | 符合执行链规则和HR规范 |

>=85 -> 交付  |  70-84 -> 有条件通过，记录缺口  |  <70 -> 退回修订

## Agent HR 管理制度

- 新增 Agent 必须提交 hr_director 入职审批，符合 obs/templates/agent_card_template.yaml Schema
- 能力描述：A级（目标）= 具体框架+工具+可量化指标；C级 = 纯活动名 -> 直接拒绝
- 新 Agent 默认 status: probation，capability_architect 评审后升 active
- 每周一 audit_agents.py 自动运行，<85分自动触发能力升级
- 能力重叠 >30% 的申请不予批准；团队超过8人需L3决策批准

## 执行原则

- 禁止以时间估算工作计划（AI团队执行效率高，时间标注误导预期）
- 任务未达成目标前不停止，不因换日换会话中断
- 每次审查必须检查遗留未完成项
- Harness 熵値预算：CLAUDE.md <= 300行。>285行触发警告，>300行硬性阻止新增

## 跨会话状态管理

会话结束前，Lysander 必须：
1. 将进行中任务写入 agent-butler/config/active_tasks.yaml
2. 记录当前执行链环节和阻塞项

新会话开始时，Lysander 必须：
1. 读取 active_tasks.yaml
2. 如有进行中任务，向总裁简要汇报并继续执行

## 自动化日程 (n8n)

    6:00am Dubai  -- 任务恢复Agent: 检查 active_tasks.yaml，续接未完成工作
    8:00am Dubai  -- 情报日报Agent: AI前沿动态 -> 筛选 -> HTML报告 -> git push
    10:00am Dubai -- 情报行动Agent: 日报建议 -> 4专家评估 -> Harness Ops执行
    完成后        -- Slack通知总裁刘子杨

详细触发配置：agent-butler/config/n8n_integration.yaml

## 升级体系

当总裁说 升级 Synapse / 更新体系 / /upgrade 时，harness_engineer 执行：
1. 读取 VERSION -> 对比 https://lysander.bond/api/synapse/version
2. 展示 Changelog，请总裁确认
3. 确认后下载新版 Layer 2，保留 Layer 3 个人配置
4. 更新 VERSION -> integration_qa 验证 -> 提示重启会话

## 凭证管理

敏感凭证存储在 obs/credentials.md（Meld Encrypt 加密，已加入 .gitignore）。

    python creds.py list                   -- 查看所有Key名（无需密码）
    python creds.py get KEY_NAME -p pwd    -- 获取单个凭证

## Migration Plan

### What Gets Deprecated

| System | Status | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| synapse-core v2.0-alpha | **Superseded** | Archive; migrate generator.py + validator.py to tools/ |
| ai-team-system v1.0 | **Superseded** | Archive; migrate hr_base.py, n8n config, PDG cards |
| Multi-Agents System v1.0 | **Superseded** | Archive; migrate QUICKSTART.md, COLLEAGUE_GUIDE.md |
| Claude Code Parent v1.0-enh | **Active -> v3.0** | Becomes primary daily-work instance, points to new CLAUDE.md |

### Migration Phases (No Execution Until Approved)

**Phase 1**: Create directory tree, synapse.yaml, migrate generator.py + validator.py + hr_base.py
**Phase 2**: Create 46 agent YAML cards, agent_card_template.yaml, organization.yaml, run validator.py
**Phase 3**: Write 8 harness fragments, run generator.py, verify line count <= 280
**Phase 4**: Write path-agnostic CEO Guard (settings.json + hooks), test blocking/override/audit
**Phase 5**: Write skills/dispatch.md, migrate 4 SPE skill files
**Phase 6**: Write/migrate organization.yaml, n8n_integration.yaml, decision_rules.yaml
**Phase 7**: Write tests, QUICKSTART.md, COLLEAGUE_GUIDE.md, agent-hr docs
**Phase 8**: Full validation pass + cutover

### What Is NOT Migrated

- knowledge_chandu_expert: removed permanently (naming artifact)
- Hard-coded absolute paths in settings.json: replaced entirely
- 3.5/5.0 and 4.2/6.0 QA thresholds: replaced with 85/100
- Multi-Agents Academy invitation code system: archived (public product scope)

---

## Implementation Plan (Post-Approval)

All steps execute after president approval. harness_ops executes; Lysander dispatches and reviews at each gate.

Phase Gate Model: Each phase requires QA >= 85/100 before advancing. No exceptions.

Step 1 (harness_engineer): Create directory tree, synapse.yaml, VERSION. Gate: all base files exist.
Step 2 (hr_director + capability_architect): Create 46 YAML cards. Gate: all pass validator.py, 0 C-level violations.
Step 3 (harness_engineer): Write 8 harness fragments, run generator.py. Gate: output matches Section 6, line count 270-280.
Step 4 (ai_systems_dev + integration_qa): Write CEO Guard. Gate: blocking/override/audit all verified.
Step 5 (ai_systems_dev): Migrate hr_base.py, write audit_agents.py + tests. Gate: all tests pass.
Step 6 (harness_engineer): Write dispatch.md, migrate SPE skills. Gate: /dispatch routes all 13 cases correctly.
Step 7 (harness_engineer + ai_systems_dev): Write/migrate config files. Gate: all YAML validates.
Step 8 (knowledge_engineer): QUICKSTART.md, COLLEAGUE_GUIDE.md, agent-hr docs. Gate: >= 85/100.
Step 9 (integration_qa): Full validation pass. Target: >= 90/100 overall.
Step 10 (harness_engineer + Lysander): Cutover. Verification checklist:
- [ ] Greeting fires correctly on first message
- [ ] /dispatch routes correctly for all 13 routing cases
- [ ] CEO Guard blocks Edit/Write/Bash in main session
- [ ] CEO Guard override flag works and logs to audit/
- [ ] active_tasks.yaml read on session start
- [ ] QA review produces 85/100-scale score

All 6 checks pass -> declare v3.0 live -> archive deprecated repos.

---

## Open Questions for President

Only 3 questions require president input. All other design decisions are final.

---

### Q1: Domain Modules Default State

The janus and stock modules are opt-in (disabled by default). Should janus be enabled by default in your personal instance, given it is your active daily-use team?

Option A (recommended): Keep opt-in. Enable janus only in your personal synapse.yaml. Canonical system stays universal and portable.
Option B: Enable janus by default in your personal preset. Janus team (6 agents) loads in every session.

Expert recommendation: Option A. Personal synapse.yaml is the right place for domain-specific module overrides.

---

### Q2: CEO Guard Mode

The proposal recommends blocking mode. This is a significant change from the current advisory-only behavior.

Option A (recommended): Blocking mode. Override requires explicit change to settings.json. Escape hatch for genuine emergencies.
Option B: Enhanced advisory mode. High-visibility warnings, no blocking. Backward compatible.

Expert recommendation: Option A. A constraint that does not constrain is not a constraint. The escape hatch handles emergencies.

---

### Q3: Rollout Scope

Option A (recommended): Full cutover. Claude Code Parent CLAUDE.md replaced with v3.0. Three other repos archived.
Option B: 2-week parallel operation, then cutover.

Expert recommendation: Option A. Design is rigorously cross-validated against all 4 source systems. Parallel period adds friction without meaningful risk reduction.

---

*End of Proposal -- 9 sections*

Prepared by: Lysander CEO (orchestrator) + graphify_strategist + harness_engineer + capability_architect + integration_qa + execution_auditor + ai_ml_engineer

Next action: President Liu Ziyang responds to Q1/Q2/Q3. Upon approval, harness_ops begins Step 1 immediately.
